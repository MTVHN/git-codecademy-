# git-codecademy

Greetings, I am new to coding and learning without prior knowledge. 

This respository will host projects/challenges from Codecademy. With that said, I am using Codecademy as my learning platform. I've used MDN Documentation, StackOverflow and others as supplemental resources to help in accomplishing these projects. I welcome any feedback on codes - these were my take on how to solve the problem. 

With Graittude!
